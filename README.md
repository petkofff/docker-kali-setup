# docker-kali-setup
My Kali Linux Docker setup

##  build the image
```
git clone https://github.com/petkofff/docker-kali-setup.git
cd docker-kali-setup
docker build -t kali-ready .
```
I suggest that you grab a cup of coffee, it's going to take a long time.

## run the image
It's kinda long command, so it deserves its own script. 
```
./start-kali.sh
```
